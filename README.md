# nicegui-docs
This repo contains an example introductory section for nicegui docs.  The introduction consists of [Section 1. Overview](overview.md) and subpages, which introduce basic nicegui concepts needed to build apps.  It does so by developing a sample app, with each subsection adding more elements to the same app.  Examples should be brief and just show basic functionality to illustrate the important concepts.

Later sections 2... of the docs are meant to be made from existing nicegui docs page, split into sections.

Ways to improve this overview: 
- add links to other sections wherever they are mentioned
- add screenshots showing rendered output of sample app after each code block
- later subsections from 1.4 haven't been filled in yet.  follow same model as existing subsections 1.1 - 1.3
- add styling to code blocks highlighting new code added to app in that block, distinguishing from existing code in previous example
