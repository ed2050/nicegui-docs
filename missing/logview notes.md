I recently started using logview to show output from external programs.  Works great, but ran into some tricky bits.  Thought I'd share for others.

## Usage

I wanted a function that does the following:
- take a command for external program with args and run it
- show an indicator while external prog running (ui.spinner)
- show text results (stdout, stderr) on page when finished (ui.log).

Implementation of this func as `runprog()` at end of this post.  Pretty straightforward.  Usage is like this:

```py
@ui.page ('/somepage') 
def somepage () :
    heading ('Some Page', 1)
    
    heading ('Chosen Image', 2)
    ui.image (someimage)
    ui.button ('Show Stats').on ('click', 
        lambda : runprog (['imgstats', '-psx', someimage], results)
    )
    
    results = ui.column ()
```

User clicks button, `imgstats` is invoked, results are shown on page.  Beautiful.

## Tricky bits

Here's the result with default quasar styling.  Total mess.  I assure you there is output text in the box, though you have to really squint to see it (text is highlighted to help).

The tricky bits are fixing Quasar's default settings, which are awful:
1. It creates a very small box about 15 chars wide by 2 rows high.  You can't fit anything in there.
2. Text doesn't wrap.  Long lines force horizontal scrolling.
3. Text is blurry and impossible to read.  For godforsaken reasons, quasar puts a high opacity (0.4 iirc) on logview (technically on <textarea> with disabled attribute).  Goodbye contrast, hello vision trouble! ðŸ¤“ 
4. Difficult to change logview height.  Quasar sticks a height **attribute** on generated <textarea> because of course, why make it possible to change with css? ðŸ™„ 

## Fixes
1 - easy to change width.  You can use classes & props in nicegui.  Even better, just set in css.  I use width and max-width so it takes all available space but isn't ridiculously wide.

2 - easy to fix by setting text-wrap.

3 - opacity can be fixed once you figure out the issue.  but have to use `!important` because quasar doesn't care about your styles.

4 - this was the trickiest.  You can set `height` but then height is fixed.  If output is short, you don't want a huge empty box.  If output is long, you don't want a short box with tons of scrolling.  So just use max-height right?

The problem is, logview contents change.  We want height to adjust dynamically.  On first display, logview is empty.  Then we log 1 or 2 info lines while external program runs.  When program finishes, we log more - maybe a little, maybe a lot.

You would think `height : fit-content` or `height : max-content` would do the trick.  But no.  They set the height once but don't adjust as content changes, from what I can tell.

Another problem is that quasar sticks a `height` property on logview.  Which overrides any css settings.  Why style with css when you can hardcode properties on each element, right quasar? Brilliant! ðŸ™„

The solution is twofold.  First, use `props('height=fit-content')` on your nicegui element to replace the pixel height crap quasar sticks on it.  Second, in your css use `field-sizing : content` to make the textarea resize dynamically.  With `max-height` as a limit.

Et voila!

## CSS

Here's the css incorporating these fixes.  And some decent margins because quasar / tailwind believe whitespace is the tool of the devil - readability be damned. ðŸ‘¿ 

```css
.nicegui-log
{
    /* fix 1 */
    width : 100% ;
    max-width : 60vw ;

    /* fix 2 */
    text-wrap : wrap ;

    /* fix 3 */
    color : #fff ;

    /* fix 4 */
    max-height : 40rem ;
    field-sizing : content ;  /* make height match content */

    margin : 1em 0 ;
}

/* fix 3 */
.disabled , [disabled]  { opacity: 0.9 !important; }  /* fucking quasar... */

```

## Code

Here's the implementation of `runprog`.

```py
# ------------------------------------------------
async \
def runprog (cmd , parent = none , savelog = false) :
    'launch cmd in new process. show results under parent.  cmd can be string or list'

    if not parent :
        parent = ui.column ().classes ('cmdresult')

    cmdtext = cmd
    if istype (cmd, list) :  cmdtext = ' '.join (cmd)

    with parent :
        spin   = ui.spinner (size = '3rem').props ('id=theyspinning')
        cmdlog = ui.log ().props ('height=fit-content')  # resize dynamically
        cmdlog.push (f'running cmd : { cmdtext }')
        scrollto ('theyspinning')

    def runner () :
        # helper to wait for cmd in separate thread
        proc = subprocess.run (cmd , capture_output = true , text = true)
        ret  = proc.returncode
        out  = proc.stdout or ''
        err  = proc.stderr or ''
        return ret , out , err

    cmdtext = istype (cmd, str) and cmd or ' '.join ([ f"'{ x }'" for x in cmd ])
    log (f'calling cmd : { cmdtext }')
    ret = out = err = ''

    try :
        # use io_bound to spawn separate thread
        ret , out , err = await nicegui.run.io_bound (runner)

    except Exception as e :
        warn (f'exception in cmd = { cmdtext } : { e }')

    spin.delete ()
    ui.notify (f'command complete : { ret } : { len (out) } : { len (err) }\n{ cmdtext }')

    # --- show results in logview

    cmdlog.push (f'exit val = { ret }')

    cmdlog.push ('\n--------------- STDOUT --------------')
    cmdlog.push (out or 'empty')

    cmdlog.push ('\n--------------- STDERR --------------')
    cmdlog.push (err or 'empty')

    # show command again for easy reference (avoids scrolling back to top)
    cmdlog.push (f'\nfrom cmd : { cmdtext }')

    # --- save results to log files

    if savelog :
        now     = time.time ()
        outfile = os.path.join (CMDLOGS, f'runproc.{ now }.out')
        errfile = os.path.join (CMDLOGS, f'runproc.{ now }.err')

        u.save (out, outfile)
        u.save (err, errfile)

        cmdlog.push (f'\nstdout saved  : { outfile }\nstderr saved  : { errfile }')
```
